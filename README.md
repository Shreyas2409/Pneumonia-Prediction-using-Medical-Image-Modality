# Pneumonia-Prediction-using-Medical-Image-Modality

Pneumonia is a disease which occurs in the lungs caused by a bacterial infection. Early diagnosis is an important factor
for the successful treatment process. Generally, the disease can be diagnosed from chest X-ray images by an expert radiologist.
The diagnoses can be subjective for some reasons such as the appearance of disease which can be unclear in chest X-ray images
or can be confused with other diseases. It is also much more difficult to make clinical diagnoses with chest X-rays than with other
imaging modalities. Therefore a computer aided diagnosis systems are needed as tools to assist in the clinical interpretation of
chest x-rays would therefore fulfill an unmet need.To solve this problem I have developed an application that detects
Pneumonia and predicts the accurate probability values.
